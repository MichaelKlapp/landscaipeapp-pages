# Blog Posts Directory

This directory contains individual blog post HTML files.

## How to Add a New Blog Post

When you want to add a new blog post:

1. **Upload your document** to me in the chat (Word, PDF, text file, etc.)
2. **Tell me**: "Here's another blog to upload" or similar
3. I will:
   - Convert your document to HTML
   - Create a new blog post file in this directory
   - Update the blog.html page to include your new post
   - Format it with proper styling

## File Naming Convention

Blog post files should be named using:
- Lowercase letters
- Hyphens instead of spaces
- Example: `getting-started-with-landscaping.html`

## Blog Post Structure

Each blog post should include:
- Title
- Publication date
- Content (formatted as HTML)

The blog listing page (`blog.html`) will automatically display all posts from the `blogPosts` array in its JavaScript.
