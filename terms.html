<h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

<h2>The Service</h2>
<p>LandscAIpe is a tool that helps users explore yard and landscaping ideas. The Service may include AI-generated landscape designs, cost estimate ranges, project saving and management, DIY tools, and optional contractor matching based on ZIP code and project type.</p>
<p>The Service does not perform landscaping work. We do not provide professional architectural, engineering, legal, or safety advice.</p>

<h2>Important Disclaimers</h2>

<h3>AI-generated designs and advice</h3>
<p>AI Outputs are generated automatically and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or not suitable for your property. AI Outputs are visualizations and suggestions only. They are not professional plans, and they may not be feasible, code-compliant, or safe. You are responsible for verifying any AI Outputs before acting on them.</p>
<p>Safety note: Always verify anything safety-related, especially regarding children, pets, toxicity, pesticides or chemicals, and electrical or structural work. Consult qualified professionals when appropriate.</p>

<h3>Cost estimates</h3>
<p>Cost estimates shown in the Service are ranges only and are not fixed quotes. Actual costs can vary based on labor rates, material availability, site conditions, permits and fees, contractor markups, and regional price differences. You are responsible for obtaining actual quotes from contractors.</p>

<h3>Contractor matching</h3>
<p>If you use contractor matching, you understand that contractors are independent third parties. LandscAIpe does not endorse, recommend, or guarantee any contractor, and we do not guarantee contractor availability, responsiveness, pricing, or work quality. You are responsible for vetting contractors, verifying licenses and insurance, and using written contracts for any work performed.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>The Service is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use the Service. If you are under 18, you should use the Service only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>You may need an account to access certain features. You agree to provide accurate information and keep your login credentials secure. You are responsible for all activity under your account.</p>

<h2>User Content</h2>

<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>You retain ownership of your User Content as between you and LandscAIpe.</p>

<h3>License you grant to LandscAIpe</h3>
<p>You grant LandscAIpe a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, process, and display your User Content solely to operate, provide, and improve the Service. This includes processing your photos and text through AI services when you request AI features, storing your projects and generated designs, and delivering Leads when you choose to submit them.</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have the rights needed to upload your User Content and that your User Content does not violate any law or infringe any third-party rights. Do not upload content that is illegal, harmful, or offensive, or that contains personal information of others without consent.</p>

<h2>DIY Pro Subscription</h2>

<h3>Subscription details</h3>
<p>DIY Pro is an auto-renewing monthly subscription currently priced at $3.99 per month (USD). Pricing may vary by country or may change over time. DIY Pro may unlock features such as unlimited AI design generations and DIY tools (for example, Yard Nerd, Plant ID, Plant Doctor, Plant Search, shopping lists, calculators, and measurement tools).</p>
<p>Discounted pricing may be offered for limited promotional periods. If a promotional price applies, it may be available only until the promotional end date shown in the Service.</p>

<h3>Billing and renewal</h3>
<p>Payments are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Your subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it through your App Store or Google Play subscription settings before the renewal date. Charges are billed to your Apple ID or Google Play account.</p>

<h3>Cancellation and refunds</h3>
<p>You must cancel your subscription through your device App Store or Google Play settings. Deleting your account does not cancel your subscription. After cancellation, you may retain access until the end of the current billing period. Refunds, if any, are handled by Apple or Google according to their policies, except where required by law.</p>

<h3>Restore purchases</h3>
<p>If available, you can use Restore Purchases to restore eligible subscriptions on a new device, subject to Apple or Google rules.</p>

<h2>Leads and Contractor Communication</h2>
<p>If you submit a Lead, you authorize LandscAIpe to share the information you provide (which may include name, email, phone number, address if provided, ZIP code, project details, notes, and photos) with the contractors you select so they can contact you. You understand that LandscAIpe does not control how contractors use Lead information, and contractor handling of your information is governed by the contractor's own practices.</p>

<h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Service for illegal purposes</li>
<li>Upload content you do not have rights to use</li>
<li>Upload content that infringes intellectual property or privacy rights</li>
<li>Impersonate others or provide false information</li>
<li>Attempt to reverse engineer, hack, disrupt, or abuse the Service</li>
<li>Use automated systems to access the Service in a way that harms or overloads the Service</li>
<li>Interfere with security features or access controls</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Service may rely on third-party services (for example, AI providers, hosting providers, weather providers, and crash reporting). Your use of those services may be subject to their terms and policies. LandscAIpe is not responsible for third-party service failures or issues.</p>

<h2>Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete your account in the app via Account Settings, then Delete Account, then Confirm. Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Deleting your account does not cancel subscriptions, which must be canceled separately through Apple or Google.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these Terms, if required for safety or security, or if we discontinue the Service. We may also remove or limit features at any time. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any loss resulting from termination.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LANDSCAIPE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AI OUTPUTS, COST ESTIMATES, OR INTERACTIONS WITH CONTRACTORS.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO LANDSCAIPE FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM (OR $100 IF YOU PAID NOTHING), UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW.</p>

<h2>Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless LandscAIpe LLC and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to your use of the Service, your User Content, your violation of these Terms, or your interactions with contractors.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, United States, without regard to conflict of law rules.</p>

<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve disputes informally by contacting us at support@landscaipeapp.com. If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, it will be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction, unless a different dispute process is required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the Last Updated date. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice within the Service or on our website. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and LandscAIpe regarding the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</p>
