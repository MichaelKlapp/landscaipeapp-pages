<h3>Tracking Technologies (Website) and Local Device Storage (App)</h3>
<p>Our website may use cookies or similar technologies. Our mobile app may use local device storage (for example, to store settings, in-progress project flow data, and identifiers used for analytics and reliability).</p>

<h2>Use of Data</h2>
<p>We use the collected data for purposes that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing and maintaining the Service</li>
<li>Creating and managing your account and authentication</li>

<h2>AI Processing</h2>

<p>When you use these features, we may send relevant inputs to our AI provider, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photos you upload (encoded for transmission)</li>
<li>Prompts or questions you enter</li>
<li>Project preferences (budget, style, features)</li>
<li>ZIP-derived location context (city and state)</li>

<p>AI outputs are generated automatically and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or not suitable for your situation. You are responsible for how you use AI outputs.</p>

<h2>Retention of Data</h2>
<p>We retain Personal Data and User Content only for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes (such as security, dispute resolution, and compliance).</p>
<p>Usage Data is generally retained for shorter periods, except where it is used to strengthen security, improve functionality, or where we are legally obligated to retain it longer.</p>

<h2>Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You can delete your account in the app via Account Settings, then Delete Account, then Confirm.</p>
<p>When you delete your account, we aim to delete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files associated with your account (such as profile photos, favorite images, generated images)</li>
<li>Associated database records tied to your user ID (such as profile, favorites, shopping lists, subscription records, Leads, and related audit records)</li>
<li>Your authentication record</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Deleting your account does not automatically cancel subscriptions. Subscriptions must be canceled through your Apple App Store or Google Play settings, and access may continue until the end of the billing period.</p>

<h2>Transfer of Data</h2>
<p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws may differ.</p>
<p>By using the Service and submitting information, you consent to such transfers.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Data</h2>

<h3>Contractors (when you submit a Lead)</h3>
<p>If you submit a Lead, we disclose the Lead information to the contractors you selected so they can contact you about your request. Contractors are independent third parties, and their privacy practices apply to their handling of your information.</p>

<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We may share information with Service Providers who help us operate the Service. These providers have access to information only to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to use it for other purposes.</p>

<h3>Business Transaction</h3>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice if your Personal Data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (for example, a court or government agency), or to protect rights, safety, and security.</p>

<h2>Security of Data</h2>
<p>We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect your information, including encryption in transit (HTTPS) and access controls. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100 percent secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p>We store photos and images in private storage and use signed access where applicable.</p>

<h2>Do Not Track Signals (Website)</h2>
<p>Our website may not respond to Do Not Track signals. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting your browser settings.</p>

<h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or request a copy of your personal information, and to object to or restrict certain processing.</p>
<p>You can update certain account and profile information within the Service, and you can delete your account in-app. For other requests, contact us using the information below. We may ask you to verify your identity before responding.</p>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to operate the Service, including:</p>
<ul>

<li>Google Gemini (AI image generation, Yard Nerd chat, plant tools)</li>
<li>Sentry (crash reporting and diagnostics)</li>
<li>Open-Meteo (weather data)</li>
<li>Apple App Store and Google Play (subscription processing)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>We may provide paid subscriptions within the Service (for example, a DIY Pro subscription). Payments are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play, and we do not store or collect payment card details.</p>
<p>We may store subscription-related records such as receipts or tokens, transaction identifiers, and subscription status to verify entitlements and provide subscriber access.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is a general-audience app focused on home and yard projects and is not directed to children under 13.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided Personal Data, please contact us.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>The Service may contain links to third-party sites or services that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third parties.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the Last Updated date. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice within the Service or on our website.</p>
